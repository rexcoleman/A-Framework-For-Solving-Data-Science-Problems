# Reproducing Excellence: A Framework for Solving Data Science Problems

## Executive Summary

Welcome to my Framework for Solving Data Science Problems repository. This repository showcases a project that not only demonstrates my data science skills but also outlines a comprehensive framework for solving data science problems. The project is inspired by one of the most popular notebooks on Kaggle, leveraging best-in-class methodologies to create a reliable foundation for solving data science problems. By reproducing this work, I aim to illustrate the value of learning from top practitioners while also solving one of the most important problems in data science.

Rushing into a data science project without a structured approach can lead to numerous problems, which can severely impact project success, cost, and outcomes reliability. This project addresses these issues by implementing a well-defined framework and best practices ensuring thorough problem understanding, effective data preprocessing, and robust model evaluation.

The project is applied to the popular "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" Kaggle competition.

Thank you for visiting my repository. I hope this project inspires you to implement a structured approach to avoid common data science pitfalls.

## Introduction

The motivation behind this project is twofold:

1. **Learning from the Best**: By reproducing work from top data scientists, we can gain valuable insights and understand the methodologies that lead to successful projects.
2. **Framework Development**: Creating a robust framework for data science projects that can be applied to various datasets and problems, ensuring a structured approach to avoid common pitfalls.

### Problems Related to Rushing into a Data Science Project

Rushing into a data science project without a structured approach can lead to numerous problems, severely impacting the success, reliability, and cost of the outcomes. Below is an exhaustive list of these potential issues:

1. **Inadequate Problem Understanding**:
   - Misalignment with business objectives.
   - Unclear problem definition leading to irrelevant solutions.

2. **Poor Data Collection and Exploration**:
   - Missing critical data points.
   - Overlooking data quality issues.
   - Failure to understand the data distribution and patterns.

3. **Insufficient Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Presence of noisy or irrelevant data.
   - Incorrect handling of missing values.
   - Inconsistent data formatting and scaling.

4. **Ineffective Feature Engineering**:
   - Missing out on key features that improve model performance.
   - Overfitting due to too many features.
   - Ignoring domain knowledge in feature selection.

5. **Inappropriate Model Selection and Training**:
   - Choosing models that are not suitable for the problem.
   - Not validating the model selection process.
   - Inadequate training leading to underfitting or overfitting.

6. **Lack of Proper Model Evaluation and Validation**:
   - Using incorrect metrics for model evaluation.
   - Not performing cross-validation to ensure model generalization.
   - Ignoring potential data leakage during validation.

7. **Inadequate Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Suboptimal model performance due to default hyperparameters.
   - Time-consuming trial and error without a systematic approach.

8. **Misinterpretation of Results**:
   - Drawing incorrect conclusions from model outputs.
   - Failure to consider model limitations and biases.

9. **Poor Model Deployment (if applicable)**:
   - Incompatibility with production environment.
   - Lack of monitoring and maintenance plan.

10. **Inadequate Documentation and Reporting**:
    - Difficult for others to understand and reproduce the work.
    - Lack of transparency in methodologies and results.

By addressing these issues through a structured approach, as demonstrated in this project, we can significantly improve the quality and reliability of data science outcomes. This framework serves as a guide for tackling data science projects methodically and effectively.

## Data Science Framework

1. ### Define the Problem
   If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? Problems should precede requirements, requirements should precede solutions, solutions should precede design, and design should precede technology.

2. ### Gather the Data
   Chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective. The goal is to find and consolidate these datasets.

3. ### Prepare Data for Consumption
   Data wrangling is a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. This includes data extraction, data cleaning, and preparing data for analysis by implementing data architectures, developing data governance standards, and ensuring data quality.

   Used 4 C's of Data Cleaning: Correcting, Completing, Creating, Converting.

4. ### Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
   Deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations, and comparisons in the dataset. Data categorization is also important to select the correct hypothesis test or data model.

5. ### Model Data
   Data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. The dataset and expected results determine the algorithms available for use. Algorithms are tools that must be selected appropriately for the job.

   Included generalized framework for model selection. Created baseline with simple back-of-the-envelope decision tree and ran the following models relevant to this problem:

   ```python
   MLA = [
       # Ensemble Methods
       ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier(),
       ensemble.BaggingClassifier(),
       ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier(),
       ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier(),
       ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(),
       
       # Gaussian Processes
       gaussian_process.GaussianProcessClassifier(),
       
       # GLM
       linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV(),
       linear_model.PassiveAggressiveClassifier(),
       linear_model.RidgeClassifierCV(),
       linear_model.SGDClassifier(),
       linear_model.Perceptron(),
       
       # Naive Bayes
       naive_bayes.BernoulliNB(),
       naive_bayes.GaussianNB(),
       
       # Nearest Neighbor
       neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier(),
       
       # SVM
       svm.SVC(probability=True, max_iter=10000),
       svm.NuSVC(probability=True, max_iter=10000),
       svm.LinearSVC(max_iter=10000),
       
       # Trees    
       tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(),
       tree.ExtraTreeClassifier(),
       
       # Discriminant Analysis
       discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis(),
       discriminant_analysis.QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis(),
       
       # xgboost
       XGBClassifier()    
   ]


6. ### Validate and Implement Data Model
Test your model to ensure it hasn't overfit or underfit your dataset. Determine if your model generalizes well by validating it with a subset of data not used during training.

Used hyperparmmeter tuning and model ensembling to improve performance.

7. ### Optimize and Strategize
Iterate through the process to make the model better. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to focus on recommendations and design while outsourcing developer operations and application plumbing.
