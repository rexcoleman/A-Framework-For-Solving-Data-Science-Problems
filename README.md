# A-Framework-For-Solving-Data-Science-Problems

## Executive Summary

Welcome to myFramework For Solving Data Science Problems repository.  This repository showcases a project that not only demonstrates my data science skills but also outlines a comprehensive framework for solving data science problems. The project is inspired by one of the most popular notebooks on Kaggle, leveraging best-in-class methodologies to create a reliable foundation for solving data science problems. By reproducing this work, I aim to illustrate the value of learning from top practitioners while also solving one of the most important problems in data science.

Rushing into a data science project without a structured approach can lead to numerous problems, which can severely impact the success, reliability and cost of the outcomes. Below is an exhaustive list of these potential issues:

### Problems Related to Rushing into a Data Science Project

1. **Inadequate Problem Understanding**:
   - Misalignment with business objectives.
   - Unclear problem definition leading to irrelevant solutions.

2. **Poor Data Collection and Exploration**:
   - Missing critical data points.
   - Overlooking data quality issues.
   - Failure to understand the data distribution and patterns.

3. **Insufficient Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Presence of noisy or irrelevant data.
   - Incorrect handling of missing values.
   - Inconsistent data formatting and scaling.

4. **Ineffective Feature Engineering**:
   - Missing out on key features that improve model performance.
   - Overfitting due to too many features.
   - Ignoring domain knowledge in feature selection.

5. **Inappropriate Model Selection and Training**:
   - Choosing models that are not suitable for the problem.
   - Not validating the model selection process.
   - Inadequate training leading to underfitting or overfitting.

6. **Lack of Proper Model Evaluation and Validation**:
   - Using incorrect metrics for model evaluation.
   - Not performing cross-validation to ensure model generalization.
   - Ignoring potential data leakage during validation.

7. **Inadequate Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Suboptimal model performance due to default hyperparameters.
   - Time-consuming trial and error without a systematic approach.

8. **Misinterpretation of Results**:
   - Drawing incorrect conclusions from model outputs.
   - Failure to consider model limitations and biases.

9. **Poor Model Deployment (if applicable)**:
   - Incompatibility with production environment.
   - Lack of monitoring and maintenance plan.

10. **Inadequate Documentation and Reporting**:
    - Difficult for others to understand and reproduce the work.
    - Lack of transparency in methodologies and results.
